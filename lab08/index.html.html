    <h1>Julian's Matthews Biography</h1>
    <p>
     My name is Julian Matthews and I am currently attending <strong>Syracuse University</strong>. I am enrolled in the iSchool at Syracuse and my major is information management and data analytics. I choose this major because I feel there is a large job pool for this field. I also believe this field will have a big market for jobs for a long time due to the increase in technology in the past decade.

    <p>
        In my past, I was a two sport athlete in high school playing baseball and football all four years. I have also had a part time job for the better half two years at a nationally renown deli called Rockyâ€™s deli in Millwood New York. I have also had three other jobs prior including, gym staff, and Manager of Sleepy Hollow Country club course maintenance and landscaping. I have a family of 6 with three little brothers. I have two dogs Frisco and Milo who are both little balls of crazy. My family is all very close in age with all of my brothers being no more than 2 years apart in age.
